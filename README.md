# TeamSpeak 3 PHP Framework

Current Version: **1.1.24**

Current Pre-Release: **1.1.27**

Initially released in January 2010, the TS3 PHP Framework is a powerful, open source, object-oriented framework implemented in PHP 5 and licensed under the GNU General Public License. Itâ€™s based on simplicity and a rigorously tested agile codebase. Extend the functionality of your servers with scripts or create powerful web applications to manage all features of your TeamSpeak 3 Server instances.

Tested. Thoroughly. Enterprise-ready and built with agile methods, the TS3 PHP Framework has been unit-tested from the start to ensure that all code remains stable and easy for you to extend, re-test with your extensions, and further maintain.

### Why should I use the TS3 PHP Framework rather than other PHP libraries?

The TS3 PHP Framework is a is a modern use-at-will framework that provides individual components to communicate with the TeamSpeak 3 Server.

There are lots of arguments for the TS3 PHP Framework in comparison with other PHP based libraries. It is the most dynamic and feature-rich piece of software in its class and delivers unprecedented performance when used correctly.

### Requirements

The TS3 PHP Framework currently supports PHP 5.2.1 or later, but we strongly recommend the most current release of PHP for critical security and performance enhancements. If you want to create a web application using the TS3 PHP Framework, you need a PHP 5+ interpreter with a web server configured to handle PHP scripts correctly.

Note that the majority of TS3 PHP Framework development and deployment is done on nginx, so there is more community experience and testing performed on Apache than on other web servers.

* Fully object-oriented PHP 5 and E_STRICT compliant components

* Integrated full featured and customizable TSViewer interfaces
